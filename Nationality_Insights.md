## Player Nationality Insights
The information in the analysis below applies to players who contributed points to my Yahoo fantasy team only. The roster size restrictions for my league were as follows:

|Position|MAX Number of Players|
|--------|---------------------|
|Centremen (C)|2|
|Left Wingers (LW)|2|
|Right Wingers (RW)|2|
|Defensemen (D)|4|
|Goalies (G)|2|
|Bench Players (BN)|6|
|Injury Reserve (IR)|4|
|Not Available (NA)|1|
|MAX Total|23|

#### Roster Management
The fantasy league I am in has a ceiling on the number of players who can contribute to your team. However, the nationality of these players is constatnly changing because:
1. Add/Drop Option: 
There is the option to add and drop your players if they are not performing well, or there are too many players of one position. 

2. Managing Injury Reserves:
Players often get injured, but they are not always dropped. Instead, team managers will put them on injury reserve (IR). When placed on IR, team managers are able to add a player without dropping the injured one. 

Because I took advantage of these strategies to change out players who were not performing well or injured, the insights provided below will not always be consistent. However, they still convey an idea of the nationality behing the fantasy point production of my team.
