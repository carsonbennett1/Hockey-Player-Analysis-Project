### Player Nationality Insights
The information in the analysis below applies to players who contributed points to my Yahoo fantasy team only. The roster size restrictions for my league were as follows:

|Position|MAX Number of Players|
|--------|---------------------|
|Centremen (C)|2|
|Left Wingers (LW)|2|
|Right Wingers (RW)|2|
|Defensemen (D)|4|
|Goalies (G)|2|
|Bench Players (BN)|6|
|Injury Reserve (IR)|4|
|Not Available (NA)|1|
|MAX Total|23|

#### Add/Drop Technicality
While the fantasy league I was in had a ceiling on the number of players who could contribute to your team, there is the option to add and drop other players if you desire. Because I took advantage of this strategy to change out players who were not performing well, the insights provided below will not always be consistent.

As seen below, the players I had in Week 6 were not the same as the ones I have in Week 13. Because of this, nationality insights will change slightly from week to week.
