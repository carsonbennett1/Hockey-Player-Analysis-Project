## Player Nationality Insights
The information in the analysis below applies to players who contributed points to my Yahoo fantasy team only. The roster size restrictions for my league were as follows:

|Position|MAX Number of Players|
|--------|---------------------|
|Centremen (C)|2|
|Left Wingers (LW)|2|
|Right Wingers (RW)|2|
|Defensemen (D)|4|
|Goalies (G)|2|
|Bench Players (BN)|6|
|Injury Reserve (IR)|4|
|Not Available (NA)|1|
|MAX Total|23|

#### Roster Management
The fantasy league I am in has a ceiling on the number of players who can contribute to your team. However, the nationality of these players is constatnly changing because:
1. Add/Drop Option: 
There is the option to add and drop your players if you they are not performing well, or you have too many of one position. 

2. Managing Injury Reserves:
Players that get injured are not always dropped, but rather put on injury reserve (IR). When placed on IR, team managers are able to add a player without dropping the injured one. 

Because I took advantage of these strategies to change out players who were not performing well, or injured, the insights provided below will not always be consistent.
