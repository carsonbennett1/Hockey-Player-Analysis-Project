## Analysis Findings
Below is the insight I have gained from doing this personal project. The following findings range from player nationality, individual player performances, player comparisons, and more. It is important to note that these ***findings use dynamic data***. With that in mind, the current findings on this page may change as the current NHL season is at week 14, and will continue until week 25.

It is also important to note that Yahoo fantasy point systems vary from league to league, and the findings in this analysis project may not be applicable to other leagues. To be more specific, Yahoo fantasy records stats (goals, assists, +/-, etc), but leagues can decide which stats they would like to count. For example, some leagues include points corresponding to faceoff wins and faceoff losses, while other leagues don't. Below is the point correspondance in the league I am analyzing.

|Forward/Defensemen Stat|Fantasy Point Value|

|Goals|6|
|Assists|4|
|Plus/Minus(+/-)|2|
|Powerplay Points|2|
|Shots on Goal|0.9|
|Faceoffs Won|0.2|
|Faceoffs Lost|-0.2|

|Goalie Stat|Fantasy Point Value|

|Wins|5|
|Goals Against|-3|
|Saves|0.6|
|Shutout|5|

### 1. Centremen Data Analysis
In this section, I analyze the points attained by players who strictly play the centre ('C') position. The analysis in this section only applys to centrement who DO NOT play a secondary position (excludes players who play C/RW OR C/LW).
